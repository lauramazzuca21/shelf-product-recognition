# Shelf Product Recognition
Computer Vision and Image Processing project.

## Intro
Object detection techniques based on computer vision can be deployed in super market scenarios for the creation of a system capable of recognizing products on store shelves.
Given the image of a store shelf, such a system should be able identify the different products present therein and may be deployed, e.g. to help visually impaired costumers or to automate some common store management tasks (e.g. detect low in stock or misplaced products).
